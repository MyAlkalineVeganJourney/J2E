        <p>
          Our Sea Moss is harvested directly from St. Lucia's volcanic coastline. Wildcrafted and solar-lunar charged,
          it delivers over 95% of the nutritional compounds — including minerals, amino acids, fatty acids, and natural
          phytonutrients — required by the human body for elevated function and frequency.

        <h2>🌕 Our Preparation Process</h2>
        <p>
          Sun-dried and rinsed with St. Lucian spring water, each batch is made in small quantities and infused with
          ancestral intention. The gel is never boiled — only activated with love, crystal resonance, and alkaline
          spring water.
